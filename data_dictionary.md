### üîÅ Rolling & Merged Feature Explanation

Suffixes like `_10_x` or `_10_y` mean the stat is a **rolling 10-game average**. These are created for both the team and its opponent and are critical for capturing momentum and recent form.

Max versions (`_max`, `_max_10_x`, etc.) capture standout performances, while `_opp` and `_opp_10_y` columns let the model consider what kinds of opponents teams are facing.
